## Overview

MarvelFace-ID is an efficient facial recognition tool tailored for real-time identity verification in video streams. It combines face detection, feature encoding, and matching into a single, streamlined process, enabling developers to build secure and responsive authentication systems.

### Why MarvelFace-ID?

This project aims to simplify the integration of facial recognition into your applications, ensuring fast, accurate, and reliable identity verification. The core features include:

- **Face Detection & Recognition**: Detects faces in live video feeds and matches them against a reference database.
- **Annotated Video Output**: Provides real-time visual feedback with labeled faces for easy monitoring.
- **Feature Encoding & Matching**: Extracts facial features and compares them efficiently for precise identification.
- **Secure Authentication**: Serves as a foundational component for user verification workflows.
- **High Performance**: Designed for low-latency processing suitable for real-time applications.
